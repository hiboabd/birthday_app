# Welcome to A Simple Birthday Greeter App üëã

This web app posts a birthday message if it's a user's birthday or it will tell the user how many days are remaining until their birthday.

More specifically, the web app asks the user for a name and birthday. When the user submits the form, and depending on the current date, the app will either:

  - wish the user happy birthday
  - tell them how long they'll have to wait until their next birthday
